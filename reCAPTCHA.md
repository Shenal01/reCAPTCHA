### ⚙️ Implementing Adaptive Thresholds

Given the variability in user behavior across different pages, it's essential to set context-specific thresholds for reCAPTCHA v3 scores:

- **High-sensitivity pages** (e.g., login or payment pages): Set a higher threshold (e.g., 0.7) to trigger additional verification for lower scores.

- **Low-sensitivity pages** (e.g., article pages): Set a lower threshold (e.g., 0.3) to minimize false positives and avoid disrupting user experience.

This approach allows for a balance between security and usability, tailoring the bot detection sensitivity to the specific context of each page.

## Behavioral Analysis Rules

1. **Interaction Timing**:
    
    - **Rule**: If a user completes a form or performs multiple actions (e.g., clicks, scrolls) in an unrealistically short time (e.g., under 1 second), flag as suspicious.
    
    - **Justification**: Humans typically take longer to interact with elements, whereas bots can execute actions almost instantaneously.
    
2. **Mouse Movement Patterns**:
    
    - **Rule**: If mouse movements are linear or lack variability, consider the behavior bot-like.
    
    - **Justification**: Human mouse movements are generally erratic and non-linear, while bots may simulate straight-line movements.[WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/bot-detection-with-js-tagging?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
3. **Scroll Behavior**:
    
    - **Rule**: If a user scrolls through a page at a constant speed without pauses, flag as potential bot activity.
    
    - **Justification**: Humans often scroll irregularly, pausing to read content, unlike bots that may scroll uniformly.[WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/bot-detection-with-js-tagging?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
4. **Keystroke Dynamics**:
    
    - **Rule**: If typing speed is abnormally fast or lacks natural pauses, mark as suspicious.
    
    - **Justification**: Bots can input text at speeds unattainable by humans, without the natural variability in typing.

## 🌐 Technical and Environmental Checks

1. **IP Reputation**:
    
    - **Rule**: If the user's IP address is associated with known malicious activity, block or challenge the user.
    
    - **Justification**: Utilizing IP reputation databases can help identify and mitigate known threats.[DataDome](https://datadome.co/guides/captcha/recaptchav2-recaptchav3-efficient-bot-protection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Vercara+1Radware+1](https://vercara.digicert.com/resources/bot-detection-how-to-identify-and-block-bots?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
2. **User-Agent Validation**:
    
    - **Rule**: If the User-Agent string is missing, malformed, or matches known bot signatures, consider the request suspicious.
    
    - **Justification**: Bots may use generic or outdated User-Agent strings, which can be indicative of non-human traffic.[WorkOS+2Radware+2Vercara+2](https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/bot-management/bot-detection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
3. **JavaScript and Cookie Support**:
    
    - **Rule**: If the client does not support JavaScript or cookies, flag as potential bot.
    
    - **Justification**: Most bots do not execute JavaScript or handle cookies as browsers do.

## 1. IP Reputation Check

**Objective**: Determine if an IP address is associated with malicious activity.

**Implementation**:

You can use services like [APIVoid](https://www.apivoid.com/api/ip-reputation/) to check the reputation of an IP address.

**Python Example using APIVoid**:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
ip_address = '1.2.3.4'
url = f'https://endpoint.apivoid.com/iprep/v1/pay-as-you-go/?key={API_KEY}&ip={ip_address}'

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

if data['data']['report']['blacklists']['engines_count'] > 0:
    print("Suspicious IP detected.")
else:
    print("IP is clean.")
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Suspicious IP detected.
```

---

## 2. JavaScript Execution Verification

**Objective**: Check if the client's browser executes JavaScript, as bots often do not.

**Implementation**:

Embed a JavaScript snippet that sets a cookie or sends a request back to the server upon execution.

**JavaScript Snippet**:

```html
<script>
  fetch('/js-executed', { method: 'POST' });
</script>
```

**Server-Side Handling (e.g., in Python Flask)**:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/js-executed', methods=['POST'])
def js_executed():
    # Mark session as having executed JS
    session['js_executed'] = True
    return '', 204
```

**Validation**:

On subsequent requests, check if `session['js_executed']` is set. If not, the client may not support or have executed JavaScript.

---

## 3. User-Agent Validation

**Objective**: Identify requests with missing, malformed, or known bot User-Agent strings.

**Implementation**:

Compare the User-Agent string against a list of known bot signatures or check for anomalies.

**Python Example**:

```python
from flask import request

user_agent = request.headers.get('User-Agent', '')

known_bots = ['curl', 'wget', 'python-requests', 'scrapy']

if any(bot in user_agent.lower() for bot in known_bots) or user_agent == '':
    print("Potential bot detected based on User-Agent.")
else:
    print("User-Agent appears legitimate.")
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Potential bot detected based on User-Agent.
```

---

## 4. Session Duration and Activity Monitoring

**Objective**: Detect sessions with unusually short durations and high activity, indicative of bots.

**Implementation**:

Track session start and end times along with user interactions.

**Python Example using Flask**:

```python
from flask import Flask, session, request
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

@app.before_request
def track_session():
    if 'start_time' not in session:
        session['start_time'] = time.time()
        session['interaction_count'] = 0
    else:
        session['interaction_count'] += 1

@app.route('/end-session')
def end_session():
    duration = time.time() - session['start_time']
    interactions = session['interaction_count']
    if duration < 5 and interactions > 10:
        print("Suspicious session detected.")
    else:
        print("Session appears normal.")
    session.clear()
    return 'Session ended.'
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Suspicious session detected.
```

## 5. Request Rate Limiting

**Objective**: Prevent clients from making an excessive number of requests in a short period.

**Implementation**:

Use a rate-limiting mechanism to track and limit the number of requests per IP address.

**Python Example using Flask and a Simple In-Memory Store**:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
request_counts = {}

@app.before_request
def limit_remote_addr():
    ip = request.remote_addr
    now = time.time()
    window = 60  # time window in seconds
    max_requests = 100

    if ip not in request_counts:
        request_counts[ip] = []

    # Remove timestamps older than the window
    request_counts[ip] = [timestamp for timestamp in request_counts[ip] if now - timestamp < window]

    if len(request_counts[ip]) >= max_requests:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Too many requests'}), 429

    request_counts[ip].append(now)
```

**Sample Output**:

If the client exceeds 100 requests in 60 seconds:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests"
}
```

## 1. Interaction Timing

**Objective**: Detect if a user completes actions (e.g., form submissions) in an unrealistically short time, which may indicate bot activity.

**Implementation**:

```javascript
let interactionStartTime = Date.now();

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  interactionStartTime = Date.now();
});

document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', () => {
  const interactionEndTime = Date.now();
  const duration = interactionEndTime - interactionStartTime; // in milliseconds

  if (duration < 1000) {
    console.warn('Suspiciously fast interaction detected:', duration, 'ms');
    // Flag as potential bot
  } else {
    console.log('Interaction duration:', duration, 'ms');
    // Proceed normally
  }
});
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Suspiciously fast interaction detected: 450 ms
```

**Validation Logic**:

- If `duration < 1000` milliseconds, flag the session as suspicious.
    

---

## 2. Mouse Movement Patterns

**Objective**: Identify linear or low-variability mouse movements, which are characteristic of bots.

**Implementation**:

```javascript
let mouseMovements = [];
let lastX = null;
let lastY = null;

document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {
  if (lastX !== null && lastY !== null) {
    const dx = event.clientX - lastX;
    const dy = event.clientY - lastY;
    mouseMovements.push({ dx, dy });
  }
  lastX = event.clientX;
  lastY = event.clientY;
});

// Analyze after a set interval
setTimeout(() => {
  const angles = mouseMovements.map(movement => Math.atan2(movement.dy, movement.dx));
  const meanAngle = angles.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / angles.length;
  const variance = angles.reduce((a, b) => a + Math.pow(b - meanAngle, 2), 0) / angles.length;
  const stdDev = Math.sqrt(variance);

  if (stdDev < 0.1) {
    console.warn('Low variability in mouse movements detected. Potential bot.');
    // Flag as potential bot
  } else {
    console.log('Mouse movement variability within normal range.');
    // Proceed normally
  }
}, 5000); // Analyze after 5 seconds
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Low variability in mouse movements detected. Potential bot.
```

**Validation Logic**:

- If `stdDev < 0.1`, indicating low variability in movement angles, flag as suspicious.
    

---

## 3. Scroll Behavior

**Objective**: Detect constant-speed scrolling without pauses, which may indicate automated behavior.

**Implementation**:

```javascript
let scrollEvents = [];

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const scrollY = window.scrollY;
  scrollEvents.push({ timestamp, scrollY });
});

// Analyze after a set interval
setTimeout(() => {
  let isConstantSpeed = true;
  for (let i = 1; i < scrollEvents.length; i++) {
    const deltaY = scrollEvents[i].scrollY - scrollEvents[i - 1].scrollY;
    const deltaTime = scrollEvents[i].timestamp - scrollEvents[i - 1].timestamp;
    const speed = deltaY / deltaTime;

    if (i > 1) {
      const prevSpeed = (scrollEvents[i - 1].scrollY - scrollEvents[i - 2].scrollY) /
                        (scrollEvents[i - 1].timestamp - scrollEvents[i - 2].timestamp);
      if (Math.abs(speed - prevSpeed) > 0.01) {
        isConstantSpeed = false;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  if (isConstantSpeed) {
    console.warn('Constant-speed scrolling detected. Potential bot.');
    // Flag as potential bot
  } else {
    console.log('Scrolling behavior within normal range.');
    // Proceed normally
  }
}, 5000); // Analyze after 5 seconds
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Constant-speed scrolling detected. Potential bot.
```

**Validation Logic**:

- If scrolling speed remains constant across multiple events, flag as suspicious.

## 4. Keystroke Dynamics

**Objective**: Analyze typing speed and variability to detect unnatural typing patterns indicative of bots.

**Implementation**:

```javascript
let keystrokeTimings = [];
let lastKeyTime = null;

document.addEventListener('keydown', () => {
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  if (lastKeyTime !== null) {
    keystrokeTimings.push(currentTime - lastKeyTime);
  }
  lastKeyTime = currentTime;
});

// Analyze after a set interval
setTimeout(() => {
  if (keystrokeTimings.length === 0) {
    console.warn('No keystroke data collected.');
    return;
  }

  const mean = keystrokeTimings.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / keystrokeTimings.length;
  const variance = keystrokeTimings.reduce((a, b) => a + Math.pow(b - mean, 2), 0) / keystrokeTimings.length;
  const stdDev = Math.sqrt(variance);

  if (mean < 100 || stdDev < 30) {
    console.warn('Unnatural typing patterns detected. Potential bot.');
    // Flag as potential bot
  } else {
    console.log('Typing patterns within normal range.');
    // Proceed normally
  }
}, 5000); // Analyze after 5 seconds
```

**Sample Output**:

```
Unnatural typing patterns detected. Potential bot.
```

**Validation Logic**:

- If `mean < 100` milliseconds or `stdDev < 30`, indicating fast and consistent typing, flag as suspicious.
